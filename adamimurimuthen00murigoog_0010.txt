§ 1. Anah nu Murmura, the authores the
following Chronicle ⁴ of his own days? which ern-
braces a period of forty years was born in the
reign os Edward I., and flou'rished in those of
his successors, Edward II. and Edward 111.

The erroneous dates which have been assigned “ ’
by 'some tothe period in which¹ he lived, as well

as to that os the duration of his Chronicle, have
occasioned some obscurity3 so that, as wc adopt

one or other of his biographers' chronology,

his annals are deprived of ten years’ contempo- ι
rary authority, or they are exaggerat ted toa
period os upwards of thirty beyond their actual
conclusion.

1320 to 1380, and that its aut thor lived 111 the

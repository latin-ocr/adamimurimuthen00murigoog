XX, PREFAGE'.

’ the reign of Edward ΙΙΙ. and the commencemeut
of that of Richard ΙΙ, is due to an intermediate
’ , and therefore contemporary author.²

rannus or § 10. .Is this conjecture be received, the value
iiioif'mm' of the concluding portion from 1359, or, at least,
fr0m1367,(p.203‚) will necessarily be greatly
enhanced. From p. 211 to the conclusion of the

work, this author hasbeen appropriated by Wal-
singham; and the fragment relating to Richard,

as we have seen, by the anonymous Monk of
Evesham. This Chronicle then is a guarantee

that so far these historiens are correct in their

narrative. UnfortunatelytheQueen'sCollegeMS.
is the only one which gives these annals, which
seem to have been written certainly prior to
the time of Walsingham’s laborious work. What
intervenes between 1337 and the latter portion
of this work, is very brief and notos much valna
N or is brerity its only fault: it is frequently

careless in recording facte, more than one in-
stance of which has been marked in the notes to
that portion of this edition.
euleu. §IL In conclusion the ,Editor has only to
'⁰¹¹' borrow the sentimenta expressed iu his edition
of Nicholas Trivet, and to repeat his acknow·
ledgment of the advantages this edition has
received in passing through the press of Messrs.
Bentley and Co. He has also in a particular
manner to express his obligation to the gentle·
man who so ably superintends the reading de-
partment, for his valuable assistance and sugges-
tions, especially respecting those passagesjwhich,
from the state of the MSS„ were occasionally
faulty, and often obscure.

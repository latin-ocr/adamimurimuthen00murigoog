whose diligence, general accuracy‚ and minute
research are no less uncommon than universally
acknowledged, is only a venial oversight, be-
comes a culpable offence in his copyists‚ who
ought at least to have read the annals which
they profess to 'give an account of. Nor is it
less excusahle when we find the author, in his
preface, giving such distinct particulars of his
work, that we are able to determine with cer-
tainty the exact year wherein his own narrative
commences.
In the prefacc¹ to the following work, the
'11⁸¹‘ annalist informs us vthat he was induced to write
'¹' a Chronicle, from the circumstance of his having ⁴
experienced the want of such a work ; no author
> at that time havingwritten annals which came
down to a later period than the year 1305: and
that accordingly he had collected materials, and
written down in a succinet manner such sub·
sequent events ‘out of the book of his own days,’
as he quaintly expresses it, from the period he
was capable of duly weighing the several facts
which ‘came under his. notice. He then con·
cludes by assuring us that, with the exception of
Ι the first three years of his annam, laos-1306,
¹ (which he horrowed from an anonymous Chroni-
cle he found at Westminster,) his narrative was
composed of facts which he had either heard
from credihle authority, or had himself been
personally awitness to.
personne The learned Bishop Tanner is an honourable
iiffinidm exception to the followers of Leland3 and to his

gffiloe that editor was not aware that Murimuth's
' genuine narrative proceeds ten years beyond the
point where his MS. concludes, nor that the
period of Adam’s death is approximately known,
this suppositiou cannot be received. Hall's cau·
tion in qualifying this conjecture as dubious adds
much to his deserved reputation3 and this the
more so, as the narrative of this Continuator pro·
cecds consecutively with the year after that os
the undoubted work of Murimuth.² ’
§a The anonymous author of this Continua-
tion commences, as we have mentioned, with the
year next following thatun which Hall’s MS. of
Murimuth terminatae, viz. in 1337; aud thence
continues consecutively till the year 1380. It
will be observed that the early years ol this
Chroniele, more especially the first teu years
(which are treated at large in the additional
matter of the present edition of Murimuth), are
passed over with great brevity3 noris this brevity
much enlarged till about the year 1359, from
which time it may be supposed that the author,
if contemporary, began to be more immediately
eonversant with the events he narrates. Hall
conjectures that this work is by a contemporary;
and assuredly,astheGhronicle advances, the inter-
‘nal evidence (for there is. no other) is in favour of
this supposition, and becomes more apparent
from the year 1367 to its completion. In this
conjecture we acquiesce, but with some qualifi-
cation. Hall's edition continues without a break
⁴ at the year of the accession of Richard II. an.

¹As this MS. is one of great period, it seems likely to have
beauty and careiul execution, and been a copy ol a preceding origi-
must have been written subse- nal, which would, in this suppo-
quently to the year 1380, though sition, necessarily have been the
apparently not long after that work'ofaeontemporuryhistorian.
